# wedge-material-stock-projection
This repository uses two approaches to project building and construction material stock in the US until 2050: Approach 1) uses time-series regression models and historic material consumption data, Approach 2) uses building floor area projections and material use intensities. The repository is created in collaboration with Carbon Leadership Forum.
